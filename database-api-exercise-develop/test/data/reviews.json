            "body": "Short: This phone works fine as a basic phone, if that is all you are looking for. Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for \"authorized personal only\", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now. But the limitations it has makes it so that it is only suitable for those who are not looking for anything other than making/receiving phone calls (like my parents).",

Try Sony or Samsung, their cheapest models work better than this.",

            "body": "I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a \"+\" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example \"+15551212121\" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example. Overall, I like this phone, and will probably keep it until I someday feel the need to get a smartphone-type slab of electronics.",

            "body": "I've had this phone for eons---at least 10 years, more like 12. My Nokia 1100 has been dropped many times where the back flies off and the battery flies out. It just keeps on working. No cracks or breaks. This thing has been dropped on cement more than once!! I just quit using it a week ago because I wasn't getting text messages sent from newer phones. It would come through as unreadable with the numbers 11001010 or something similar and I couldn't see who it was from either (if anyone knows how to remedy this, please tell me so I can go back to using this one!). This is my favorite phone. I also have a Samsung SGH-S425G and most recently added the Samsung Galaxy Stardust (all through Tracfone). The reason I like this Nokia 1100---I can text without ever looking at it because of the raised buttons. People with smart phones like to tell me that their phone has word prediction, which is when I get to tell them that this one does too! (Just gotta read the manual to see how to press the buttons once while spelling to get a list of suggested words). My smart phone takes me longer to do everything because it has too much stuff on it. With this one, I can make a call with 3 button presses, maybe 2. Not so on newer phones with more menus. If it weren't for needing to get text messages (work), I'd totally still be using this phone!!!!!",
